X. Introduction

This FAQ describes how to break-in to a PC (IBM-Compatible) 
from the outside in, and how to bypass most software-based
security measures. The last section details how to secure your
PC against such attacks.

Hi's and Ho's go out to: KORO the Great, Neil Chou, John 
Lundgren and those really cool Netware Hackers! [Part 2c (Getting 
past Netware) is based on parts of the Netware Hacking FAQ!]

Why did I write this? Because there were just so many 
questions on alt.2600 concerning 'How do I get past XXXXX 
security?' that I got tired of answering each one 
individually. Expect to see this FAQ expand as I find more 
bugs and holes in security software.

Many of these solutions assume you have physical access to
the PC. For example, you can't extract the hard disk or
reset the CMOS over a network, but you can do it if you
have access to the computer.

This FAQ is *NOT* written to help computer thiefs, but rather
it is intended to increase awareness of backdoors and
inefficiencies in security programs. I DO NOT CONDONE 
SCREWING UP OTHER PEOPLES' COMPUTERS AT ALL!!!!!! 

Maybe after reading this you won't trust the non-existent 
security offered by Windows 95 as much.

I would like to note that few of these tricks are new. I
simply rounded up everything that I could find and 
what I could glean from personal experience into an
organized file.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

Also, expect to see a version of this for the Macintosh,
sometime... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Hardware and Firmware

1a. The BIOS

Passwords
=========
The BIOS, short for Basic Input/Output Services, is the control 
program of the PC. It is responsible for starting up your computer, 
transferring control of the system to your operating system, and 
for handling other low-level functions, such as disk access.

NOTE that the BIOS is not a software program, insofar as it is
not purged from memory when you turn off the computer. It's 
firmware, only it is permanently and unchangeably stored in
the machine.

A convenient little feature that most BIOS manufacturers include
is a startup password. This prevents access to the system until
you enter the correct password. 

If you can get access to the system after the password has been
entered, then there are numerous software-based BIOS password 
extractors available from:

ftp://oak.oakland.edu/simtel/msdos/sysutil/amis2990.zip


Resetting the CMOS
==================
There is only one other way to get past the BIOS password. 
It involves discharging the static memory (CMOS) used to store the 
password and other system information. Once it is discharged, 
however, you have to reset all the system settings by hand.

****Follow these steps:

	 1. Start up the computer
		a. If the system allows it, enter the Setup Screen
			(Usually by pressing F1, DEL or INS during 
			the memory check)
		b. Record all the Setup Information. Double Check.
	 4. Turn off the computer
	 5. Remove the casing, and put the computer on the ground in
		such a way that you can see and access the side of 
		the motherboard with the processor on it.
	 6. Look at the motherboard. 
		a. If you can see a round, disc-like battery, then
			remove it, and let the computer sit without 
			the battery for 15-30 minutes. Put the battery 
			back in.
		b. If you have access to the circuit diagrams for the
			motherboard, look in them for the password or
			CMOS jumper. Flip it on and off.
		c. Look for a blue, soldered-in battery with a jumper
			running off of it. This jumper is for connecting
			an external battery. Pull it out to reset the
			CMOS.
	 9. Replace the computer casing.
	10. Enter the Setup Screen, and set the Setup Information
		back to the original values that you (hopefully)
		recorded. If you were unable to record this info,
		then you'll just have to set it up manually.
		[NOTE: Some newer Plug & Play BIOSes have an 
		autodetect feature that automatically sets-up the
		hard disk. Look around in the menu items in the
		BIOS setup.]

Again, I would like to mention that there are numerous password
extractors available for free off the internet and on BBSes. Try those
first. They are much cleaner and easier-to-use.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1b. Floppy Locks

Floppy Locks are generally cheap plastic inserts that hook on 
to the inside of the drive and lock it, thereby preventing you from
using the floppy drive. The locks used are usually those little
swivel locks used in computer casings to lock the keyboard.

If the lock is the swivel type, you can either pick it, or
buy a key (they're all the same).

To pick it, you'll need a *thin* flathead screwdriver
or a paperclip. To pick the lock, take the paperclip and insert it 
into the little notch on the inside of the swivel lock. Now, pull to 
the opposite side of the lock until the swivel is in the unlocked 
position.

If you choose to buy a key, you can:

	A. Go to your local computer service center, and buy
		one of these keys. (Very cheap. Often less than
		$0.75)
	B. Buy the same brand of floppy lock, and use the key
		that comes with it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1c. Last Resorts

If you are *REALLY* desperate to break-in to this PC, then 
the following *might* work:

	1. Remove the PC Casing
	2. Extract the hard disk (By unscrewing and disconnecting)
	3. Transfer it to another computer. (Make sure that it is
		NOT set as the boot drive.)
	4. Start up this computer, and access the
		hard disk from there.

This will probably not work if an encrypted file system is in
use. The only way to access such disks is to enter the password, 
or figure out a way to decrypt it, so if you forget your password,
you're hosed. :(

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOS, Windows, and Netware

2a. Getting access to DOS

With some systems, they are set up to boot directly to some sort 
of shell/security program, like Windows, or Windows 95. If you
want to get access to a DOS prompt, you have some choices:

	A. Boot from a floppy disk
	B. Bypass startup files
        C. Bypassing DriveSpace
	D. Break out of Autoexec.bat

***Booting from a floppy requires you to create a system disk. 
You can do this using the DOS command FORMAT /S which will 
format a disk and place system files on it. Also, the Windows 
format has an option allowing you to create a system floppy.

Before you create a system disk, you must determine which
floppy drive is used to boot. If the system has both a
1.2MB (5.25") Floppy Drive and a 1.44MB (3.5") Drive, it is likely
that the boot drive is the 1.2 MB floppy drive. If the computer
has only one floppy drive, it is quite safe to assume that it is
the boot drive.

However, if you are unsure as to which drive is the boot drive,
you can either find out by entering System Setup (as described
in section 1) or by observing which floppy drive is read right
before the operating system loads.

If the system is set to boot only from the hard disk, then you
can refer to Section 1 on how to reset the CMOS.

Once you have a system disk, you place it in the floppy drive,
and turn on or reset the computer. If you have done everything
right, the computer will boot from the floppy drive and you will
have access to a DOS prompt.

***Bypassing startup files is quite simple, but only works on 
versions of DOS 6.0 or better and Windows 95. When you turn on 
the computer and you see the text:

	Starting MS-DOS ...

or
	Starting PC-DOS ...

or 
	Starting Windows 95 ...

Press and hold the SHIFT or F5 key IMMEDIATELY. This will bypass 
the startup files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) as long as the 
system administrator has not disabled this feature.

Additionally, you can press and hold F8 when the startup 
text shows to enter the Boot menu. This lets you selectively
disable certain commands, or bypass the startup files totally,
among other things.

***Bypassing DriveSpace works if compression software such as
DriveSpace or DoubleSpace has been installed. If so, when
the startup text displays, press and hold Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+F8.
This will load the system without loading the compression
driver, which means you can't access the files on disk. 

HOWEVER, you can decompress the disk (DriveSpace only), or,
if all else fails, format it.

***Breaking out of AUTOEXEC.BAT is rather simple also. When the 
computer starts up and the operating system starts loading, press 
Ctrl+Break (Or Ctrl+C) repeatedly. When the AUTOEXEC.BAT executes, 
this will terminate it and drop you to DOS. This will work unless
the System administrator temporarily disabled the keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2b. Getting to DOS from Windows

If the above tactics fail, and the machine automatically loads
Windows, then you still have a chance of getting to DOS. Windows
by default gives you free access to DOS. There are special security
programs to prevent the user from accessing DOS. Most of these
can be bypassed.

Screen Savers
=============
The password protection built-in to Windows 3.1 is extremely weak.
You can bypass it by simply editing CONTROL.INI and searching for 
the Password field. Delete the junk that appears after the equal
sign.

The password protection in Windows 95 is much stronger, but you can
still bypass it by *carefully* moving or renaming all .PWL files 
in the C:\Windows directory.

Password Protection
===================

Q: Windows starts up, and you are presented with yet another 
	password dialog box. What do I do?

A:
**If this is the Primary Windows Logon or a Network logon, then you 
can usually get past it by pressing the Cancel button (No Joke!).
This is because the Logon information is used primarily for desktop
preferences and remote file sharing.

**If this is a third-party security program, such as the one built-in
to After Dark, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del when the dialog is
presented to you. Most security programs go out of their way to
be secure, and Windows 3.1 interprets this as not responding to 
the system, and thus will allow you close it. Windows 95 pops up
a neat little dialog box that lets you terminate any running 
application. How convenient. :) Once you subvert this, you can
prevent it from bothering you again by editing the LOAD= and 
RUN= sections in C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI.

Q: Windows starts up, and program manager loads, but the File menu
	is disabled, and so is DOS and File Manager. How can I access
	DOS???

A: There are many Security programs for Windows (3.1 *AND* 95) that 
	do this, and other things. There are a few ways around them:

**Try this first: 

DOS through Write
=================
	1. Go into Accessories, and start up Write (or Wordpad)
		NOT, I REPEAT NOT, NOTEPAD!!
	2. Open C:\COMMAND.COM
	3. A little dialog box will pop up. Select NO CONVERSION
	4. Select Save As...
	5. Save it as C:\WINDOWS\WINHELP.EXE
	6. If it asks if you want to overwrite WINHELP.EXE, choose
		YES
	7. Press F1. Normally, this loads Windows Help, but now it
		will create a DOS prompt window.

**Try this next:

DOS through Word
================
	1. If they have Microsoft Word installed, start it up.
	2. From the Tools Menu, select Macro.
	3. Type in a Macro name, and click "Create"
	4. When the Macro window comes up, type in one of the
		following depending on which Windows you are using:

		  For Windows 3.1: Shell Environ$("COMSPEC") 
		  For Windows  95: Shell Environ$("COMMAND") 
		  For Windows  NT: Shell Environ$("CMD")

		If all else fails: Shell "C:\COMMAND.COM"

	5. Run the macro by pressing the little play button on the
		macro toolbar. This will launch a DOS prompt.

**If you're using Windows 95, try this:

DOS through MODE
================
When Windows 95 Shuts Down and shows that dumb graphic, it's
really just sitting on top of DOS. You can actually issue DOS
commands (although the graphic will cover them) on the system 
after shutdown!!

A simple way to do this is to type:

CLS

After the graphic shows. However, the text will be in 40-column
mode, which is hard to read, and incompatible with some programs.

If you want to get a nice, clean DOS prompt, you can type:

	MODE CO80

This will reset the screen display to normal (80-column, 
16 color) mode.

Since *MOST* Windows Security programs are based on a VxD, they 
will be unloaded (along with Windows) after shutdown, leaving 
you free to explore using DOS.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2c. Getting past NetWare

This section is based on excerpts from the Netware Hacking FAQ.

Common Account Names
====================
Novell Netware has the following default accounts: SUPERVISOR, GUEST, 
and Netware 4.x has ADMIN and USER_TEMPLATE as well. All of these have 
no password set. Only a dummy would leave the SUPERVISOR and ADMIN 
accounts unprotected, so you might as well not try. However, many 
administrators will create special-purpose accounts that have 
easy-to-guess names, some with no password at all. Here are a few of 
the common ones and their typical purposes:

Account         Purpose
-------         ---------------------------------------------------
POST            Attaching to a second server for email
MAIL

PRINT           Attaching to a second server for printing
LASER
HPLASER
PRINTER
LASERWRITER

ROUTER          Attaching an email router to the server

BACKUP          May have password/station restrictions (see below), 
WANGTEK		used for backing up the server to a tape unit
		attached to the workstation. For complete backups, 
		Supervisor equivalence is required.

TEST            A test user account for temp use

ARCHIVIST       Palindrome default account for backup

CHEY_ARCHSVR    An account for Arcserve to login to the server from    
		from the console for tape backup. Version 5.01g's
		password was WONDERLAND.

GATEWAY         Attaching a gateway machine to the server
GATE

FAX             Attaching a dedicated fax modem unit to the network
FAXUSER         
FAXWORKS        

WINDOWS_PASSTHRU Although not required, per the Microsoft Win95
		Resource Kit, Ch. 9 pg. 292 and Ch. 11 pg. 401 you
		need this for resource sharing without a password.



Resetting Netware
=================
When NetWare is first installed, the account SUPERVISOR and GUEST
are left unprotected, that is, with no password. SUPERVISOR has
free run of the system. You can do anything you want.

But how can you make the server think it has just been installed 
without actually reinstalling the server and losing all data on 
the disk? Simple. You just delete the files that contain the 
security system! 

In Netware 2.x, all security information is stored in two files 
(NET$BIND.SYS and NET$BVAL.SYS). Netware 3.x stores that information 
in three files (NET$OBJ.SYS, NET$VAL.SYS and NET$PROP.SYS). The all 
new Netware 4.x system stores all login names and passwords in five 
different files (PARTITIO.NDS, BLOCK.NDS, ENTRY.NDS, VALUE.NDS 
and UNINSTAL.NDS [This last file may not be there, don't worry]).

Although Novell did a very good job encrypting passwords, they let all 
directory information easy to find and change if you can access the 
server's disk directly, using common utilities like Norton's Disk Edit. 

Using this utility as an example, I'll give a step-by-step procedure 
to make these files vanish. All you need is a bootable DOS disk,  
Norton Utilities' Emergency Disk containing the DiskEdit program and 
some time near the server.

1. Boot the server and go to the DOS prompt. To do this, just let the 
   network boot normally and then use the DOWN and EXIT commands. This 
   procedure does not work on old Netware 2.x servers and in some 
   installations where DOS has been removed from memory. In those cases, 
   you'll have to use a DOS bootable disk.

2. Run Norton's DiskEdit utility from drive A:

3. Select "Tools" in the main menu and then select "Configuration". 
   At the configuration window, uncheck the "Read-Only" checkbox. And 
   be very careful with everything you type after this point.

4. Select "Object" and then "Drive". At the window, select the C: drive 
   and make sure you check the button "physical drive". After that, 
   you'll be looking at your physical disk and you be able to see 
   (and change) everything on it.

5. Select "Tools" and then "Find". Here, you'll enter the name of the 
   file you are trying to find. Use "NET$BIND" for Netware 2, 
   "NET$PROP.SYS" for Netware 3 and "PARTITIO.NDS" for Netware 4. It is 
   possible that you find these strings in a place that is not the 
   Netware directory. If the file names are not all near each other and 
   proportionaly separated by some unreadable codes (at least 32 bytes
   between them), then you it's not the place we are looking for. In 
   that case, you'll have to keep searching by selecting "Tools" and 
   then "Find again". [In Netware 3.x, you can change all occurences of 
   the bindery files and it should still work okay])

6. You found the directory and you are ready to change it. Instead of 
   deleting the files, you'll be renaming them. This will avoid problems 
   with the directory structure (like lost FAT chains). Just type "OLD" 
   over the existing "SYS" or "NDS" extension. Be extremely careful and 
   don't change anything else.

7. Select "Tools" and then "Find again". Since Netware store the 
   directory information in two different places, you have to find the 
   other copy and change it the same way. This will again prevent 
   directory structure problems.

8. Exit Norton Disk Edit and boot the server again. If you're running 
   Netware 2 or 3, your server would be already accessible. Just go to
   any station and log in  as user Supervisor. No password will be asked. 
   If you're running Netware 4, there is one last step.

9. Load Netware 4 install utility (just type LOAD INSTALL at the console 
   prompt) and select the options to install the Directory Services. You 
   be prompted for the Admin password while doing this. After that, you 
   may go to any station and log in as user Admin, using the password 
   that you have selected.

**NOTE: If Disk Edit is unavailable, any Disk Editing utility with 
 searching capabilities will suffice.

----------------------------------------------------------------


3. Building a SECURE System

3a. Understanding the Issues

Potential "Hackers"
===================
After reading this FAQ, you've probably revised your idea of a
secure PC quite a bit. Truth be told, IBM didn't design the Personal 
Computer with security in mind. Back in 1980, their main objective was 
to get _something_ to market before Apple gobbled up all the market 
share.

After awhile, security programs started to emerge that attempted
to bridge this gap. These were quite popular, and were put into use
by many companies to prevent 'curious' employees from messing with
the computers.

However, ways to bypass these security programs were quickly found.
As long as computers are designed for convenience, and with humans
in mind, this will almost always happen.

So, who are potential "Hackers"? The answer is: Anyone. Experienced
users especially, but even newbies sometimes find weak spots. This
is not to say that everyone *is* a hacker.

As always, prevention is the best medicine. The following sections
deal with how to secure your system, both through physical and
software-based means.



Physical Security
=================
In the old days, back when computers filled multiple rooms, the 
security of a system was basically all physical: Locks, security
guards, etc. Now the emphasis has shifted away from physical security,
and is leaning more towards software-based methods. However, 
in some cases, a certain degree of physical security is in order.

**If you want to prevent people from resetting your CMOS and 
accessing the floppy drives, etc. you have to secure the system 
itself. This can be done by having the computer in a locked room, 
leaving only the screen and keyboard accessible. There are many 
products which let you extend the reach of screen and keyboard cables. 
Even some that let you control many different computers using one 
screen. 

***To protect your hard disk data, I would suggest investing in a
removable media system that lets you "hot-swap" and lock hard disks. 
The hard disk could then be easily removed (with the *unique* key)
and stored in a safe to prevent theft of data.

***Computer locks which bind your computer to a desk are good for
discouraging theft.

***There are also security devices available made by companies such as
Anchor Pad, Lucasey, and others that completely enclose the PC.  
These are devices such as lockdown pads, cables for monitors, and 
metal boxes. There are also devices that cover and lock the floppy 
and CD-ROM slots.  

Make sure that you test the computer immediately after these
lockdown devices are installed. In some instances the stress induced
on the casing can cause certain parts to malfunction.

***You can buy devices that prevent the PC electrical cord from 
being unplugged or turned on without a key.

***As one last measure of security, it's always nice to invest in
some insurance for your computer. It won't get your data back,
but it *will* give you some peace of mind.


Software-Based Security
=======================
Below is a list of measures you can take to secure your system using
software/firmware based methods. They are listed in order of 
increasing security, so minimum security would be only implementing
option #1, maximum security would be implementing #1-8. Keep in
mind that implementing any of these without implementing every item 
below it leaves possible entry points open.

	1. Set up a BIOS password for both the Setup screen *and*
	   access to the system.
		a. Make sure the password is not easily guessable
			(i.e., birthdate, name backwards, etc. are
			 easily guessed) See next section.
		b. Make sure that the password is the maximum possible
			number of characters supported by the BIOS.
	2. Disable floppy booting from within the BIOS
	3. Disable Bypass of startup files
		a. This is done by adding the line:
			SWITCHES=/F /N
		   to the CONFIG.SYS file.
		b. Additionally, you might want to precede
			all statements in the Autoexec.bat
			with CTTY NUL, and then have CTTY CON
			as the last line. This prevents breaking
			out of autoexec.bat
		c. If you use DriveSpace compression, add the
			following line to your DRVSPACE.INI file:
			SWITCHES=/F /N
		d. Add the line:
			BREAK OFF
		   This reduces the number of chances you have to
		   break out of AUTOEXEC.BAT, all though it doesn't
		   switch it off entirely
	4. Set up a DOS-based Security TSR
		a. Make sure you cannot access the floppy drive
			without a password, and that it allows
			for write-protection.
		b. Make sure it allows for password protection.
	5. Set up a Windows-Based Security program
		a. Make sure you can control which features of
			Windows you can limit or disable.
		b. Make sure it allows for password protection.
	6. Install an encrypted filesystem program. (i.e., CryptDisk)
		a. This will prevent access to the computer and
			files on the hard disk unless the password
			is entered. It will render your data 
			unaccessible even if the hard disk is 
			extracted from the system.
	7. Delete the following files:
		FORMAT
		DELTREE
		SUBST
		JOIN
		BACKUP
		RESTORE
		ATTRIB


Passwords
=========
Passwords are generally the weakest link in the security chain.
When choosing a password, remember these tips:

Do NOT choose something obvious. Swear words, your birthdate,
topics pertaining to what you do and/or your interests are are
examples of BAD passwords.

A Good Password is one that is totally random. To pick a password,
try this: Grab a dictionary. Close your eyes, and flip to a 
random page. With your eyes still closed, put your finger on a 
random spot on this page. Remember the word, and do this again. 
Combine the two words, and append a three-digit number to the end. 
You also might want to intersperse non-alphanumeric characters 
into the password in random ways, such as an odd dash or 
apostrophe here and there.

Also, NEVER write your password down. Always keep it in your head.
A simple Post-It note on your monitor can bring down all the
security that you so meticulously set up!

A good password system hides the passwords from everyone, 
including the system administrators. This means that the sys 
admins cannot tell if the users are putting in weak passwords.

One final note: When designing a security system, be sure to take
the user into account. If a system is of such high-grade security
that it is a nuisance to use, people will always find the lazy 
way to do it. (Post-it Notes...)
