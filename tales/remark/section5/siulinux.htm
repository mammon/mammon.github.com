<p>Here is the investigation of Wordperfect 7.0 for linux, an important tool if you have to write
some document but you don't want to get involved in LateX or some other scary unix text
processor. Also it could be quite useful if you have old Word 6.0/7.0 documents that must
be modified, or utilized some way. I realize there's a lack of a good WYSIWYG editor in
linux, WordPerfect is not a perfect program, is overbloated $loware&nbsp; ( its marketing
is even worse ) but, except StarOffice, is the only chance available.</p>

<p>This "Wordperfect" snippet of mine is just a small part of this essay, devoted to give a more detailed
description of X Applications, especially comercial X Applications using Motif, and this
background information will help explainig some techniques for reversing these
applications.</p>

<p>Finally the usual review of useful tools of the trade, included an updated version of

</font><u><strong><font face="Times New Roman">1. GUI, THE CHANCES.</font></strong></u></p>

<p>In the previous linux essays I tried to cover some basic concepts about Reverse
Engineering linux apps. The first one was a presentation showing the basic tools that
enable you to crack some basic programs, even without making a careful study of linux
intrinsics. The second one was an example of how to crack XWindows programs, just using
the information available and some common knowledge. </p>

<p>What else ? Well, most commercial overbloated linux applications will not carry a
complete symbol table ( as Acrobat Reader does ), therefore you'll need more than
&quot;looking for suspicious&quot; names if you want to RE your favourite $loware. AFAIK,
registration codes are not very popular in linux, but crippled/time limited programs are,
so you need some MessageBox or something for lightning the dark deep sea of instructions.
In the second essay we met some important words as &quot;widget&quot;, or functions as
Xsomething or Xtsomething. I hope at the end of this essay everything will make sense
properly.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>The GUI in XWindows is rather different from the Windoze thing. XWindows lets you more
freedom for using your own GUI, though the Object Oriented Scheme is mostly utilized. The
basic frame for building applications is given by Xlib library, which is used by EVERY
Xapplication. All these Xsomething functions are inside Xlib library. You can build your
GUI with Xlib functions, but like they are low level functions, it seems really hard for
programmers to use them and nothing but them. The next obvious step is to introduce the
ubiquitous OOP stuff somehow, especially if you can introduce it without introducing
anything at all :-D. It seems funny, but it is true, and that's what X Toolkit Intrinsics
does. Its goal is to make it easier for programmers, though it just defines the
&quot;theory&quot;, the skeleton of the object scheme made up of graphic objects named as
WIDGETS. So, a widget is the basic frame for a graphic object, may be a button, a
scrollist or whatever ( the Windoze concept of window may be useful as a comparison ) that
must be build by the application. X Toolkit also start the joint between graphic objects
and events ( it sounds better eh ? ). With the OOP behind, you may imagine that widget are
classes, inheritance and bla, bla, bla ... The Xtsomething functions come from the X
Toolkit Intrinsics. </p>

<p>Each class has its own resources. Resources, another magic word and a wide-dangerous
concept if you know Windoze resources ... is not the same. If you don't want to get
confused, think of resources as variables of the graphic interface ( that may be
initialized by the user ). One kind of resource, very important are callback lists, that
joins events with functions. </p>

<p>A third layer is necessary for making up the interface, you know, for drawing the
buttons, repainting and so on. At this point of the way, you are not worried by speed, so
better use some pre-cooked code; but firstly decide if you want to dig into your pocket
for some money or you don't want. In the first group everybody uses Motif libraries and in
the second Athenea Widget is very popular. Most commercial $loware uses motif for building
their GUIs, but that doesn't mean you must buy motif for running those programs, instead
you are punished with fat applications that got motif functions statically-linked. But
what is that motif thing ? It turns your scaring-Xwindows application in a
Windoze-look-like application, yes, motif apps look like Windoze programs ( more or less
), and then everybody is happy.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Motif is copyrighted by OSF ( Open Software Fundation ), it is a standard. There's a
project for developing free motif ( called lesstif ), but it's not been finished. Anyway
it is worth a visit, even just to get function definition ( include files ):<br>
<br>
<a href="tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#465" tppabs="http://www.lesstif.org/">http://www.lesstif.org</a><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Nowadays outside $loware, there are a growing number of alternative (almost) free GUIs
( another religion ) like GTK and Qt libraries. If we talk about these new graphic
libraries, we must talk about Window Managers. They add some look and feel to the windows
(borders more or less spartan)&nbsp; and some management capabilities (buttons and
functions to handle windows, and some interface to run programs directly ). There are a
lot ( some imitate w95 :-), and we'll not get into further details. </p>

<p>What I wanted to remark, is that now there are two projects for building window
managers based on GTK and Qt respectively. The philosophy is to extend the capabilities
and give the manager with some packed-tools (mail, editor, file manager ... ) that use the
same graphic lib, therefore everything looks the same way. This could be a
&quot;restricting&quot; approach, but surely will make it easier to linux newbies. Well,
the projects are kde (Qt) and gnome (GTK). Now you may realise there are several free
alternatives to Motif in the future. </p>

<p><br>
<br>
<font face="Times New Roman"><u><strong>2. SOME SPYING.</strong></u></font><br>
<br>
-- Ok, I'm the master of MessageBox breakpoints, what do I need in linux ?<br>
-- Wait, wait, you'll see.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>First we must learn something about real world, how these programs act, the functions
they call. Let's start with Xt details, it is important because motif libraries use them. </p>

<p>Xt must be initialized, so the function XtAppInitialize must be called. The root widget
is created, then the rest of the widgets are created mostly with the function
XtCreateManagedWidget, and the resources of each widgets are updated by the application or
by the resource database. The next step is defining the different callbacks, by means of
the XtAddCallback function. Now the widgets are data in memory but need to be shown as a
real thing with XtRealizeWidget. At last the app waits for events with XtAppMainLoop, or
some XtAppPeekEvent loop. </p>

<p>Yeah, yeah I know there are a lot of dirty details I'm not talking about them, &nbsp;
... I can give you two links with information and tutorials about Xwindows and Motif. In
the first one you may get tutorials in practically all the languages you fancy:</p>

<p><a href="tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#466" tppabs="http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.framed.html">http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.framed.html<br>
http://www.cen.com/mw3/code.html</a><br>
<br>
Motif is supposed more high-level functions, and that's true, here you have some motif
functions that may be useful:<br>
<br>
XmCreateBulletinBoardDialog<br>
XmCreateDialogShell<br>
XmCreateFileSelectionDialog<br>
XmCreateMessageDialog<br>
XmCreateErrorDialog<br>
XmCreateInformationDialog<br>
XmCreateQuestionDialog<br>
XmCreateWarningDialog<br>
XmCreateMessageBox<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Using these functions Motif offers the possibility to run precooked widgets, despite
you may create compound objects. Predefined dialog boxes are subclasses of the
BulletinBoard class, while customized dialogs just inherit DialogShell class. </p>

<p>The main motif class is called Primitive, and the rest ( labels, pushbuttons and so on
) are derived from it. In the acrobat reader essay you discovered that the function
XtSetSensitive was disabling the buttons, but what about a disabled menu. We must know how
a menu is built. </p>

<p>A class called MenuShell is the base, then you get a RowColumn widget for putting the
elements in a particular position ( do you remember Java Panels ? ). The main options
(File, Edit, and so forth) of the pulldown menus are CascadeButtons and the final options
( Open, Save, ... ) are PushButtons ( or ToggleButtons ). So, disabling a menu is the same
of disabling a button, and the XtSetSensitive function is used again. </p>

<p>Some comment about the functions above, the name XmCreateMessageBox may be tricky for
you, this class has always 3 buttons Ok, Cancel and Help, so perhaps you should think
about the basic class DialogShell ... </p>

<p>There's a VERY valuable tool for getting information about widgets hierarchy from an
application. That will solve if you don't know if the nagging box you are looking is
Bulletin, Dialog, Box or whatever :-). It is editres, that comes with usual distributions.
Editres uses the &quot;editres-protocol&quot; to communicate with Xt applications and show
a lot of information about the widget tree and its resources. The main idea of the program
is to provide a nice editor to change resources on the fly; that will not be the case for
us, but we may get a lot of interesting information of the target. Sadly not all apps
support &quot;editres-protocol&quot;. </p>

<p>If you are lucky after clicking with your mouse over the application ( Get tree option
); over a menu for example you get this tree ( taken from a dubious attempt to get a linux
ultraedit: crisp ):</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<pre><small>Crisp  mcr
	XmBulletinBoard  draw
		XmRowColumn  menu_bar
			XmCascadeButton  File
			XmCascadeButton  View
			XmCascadeButton  Edit
			XmCascadeButton  Find
			XmCascadeButton  Options
			XmCascadeButton  Tools
			XmCascadeButton  Windows
			XmCascadeButton  Help
		XmDrawingArea  container
			XmDrawingArea  toolbar
		XmDrawingArea  ruler
		XmDrawingArea  screen
			XmScrollBar  vscrollbar
			XmScrollBar  hscrollbar
		XmDrawingArea  status_bar</small></pre>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>If it is confusing for you it shows pairs of (class,identifier), firstly the parent
class called Crisp ( not quite original ), the whole visible window derived from it, and
then a menubar, a toolbar, a ruler, the &quot;edit&quot; area and the status bar; therefore
the whole graphic interface. The tree may expand even more, but in this tree don't appear
widgets not created, I mean, if I open FILE main pulldown menu, menu options are created
and widgets are reported to editres, but not before. Of course in the program everything
is shown with graphics and so on. You may see the tree labelled with not only classes or
identifiers, but with WIDGET IDs and WINDOW ids ( the last one could be got with some tools I
described in my second essay ). </p>

<p>What else ? You may as well select one of the widgets and list its resources,
especially Callback resources that could be useful ( more below ).</p>

<p><br>
<u><strong><font face="Times New Roman">3. EVENTS</font></strong></u><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>The main goal of this part is to give clues for joining events with code, in order to
get some starting point for the art of Reverse Engineer. The first idea is to exploit
Windoze exploits :-). MessageBox turned to be one of the most important functions in the
art of RE, why not carry on in linux ? You've got a good list of functions above, but I
want you asking now what happen if the motif library is statically linked. Well, I fear no
magic solution. Some programs create on-the-fly a &quot;calling table&quot;, where you may
identify clearly pairs XmFunction-&gt;address; some others just declare the functions in
the symbol table , but in some rare cases is not easy. </p>

<p>Many times that's not enough and you must try to deal somehow with events. The whole
system bares resemblance with Windows, asynchronous messages are generated by the server
as a result of actions like moving the mouse, using the keyboard ... Masking events may be
applied in different ways, but through Xt layer and through Xm ( motif ) layer messages
may travel in mysterious ways. Anyway, tracing the program's event loop is really a nightmare
journey. </p>

<p>Widgets use to manage events by means of translation tables ( previously registered and
bla, bla ), more or less a table where you pair events ( keys pressed and mouse buttons up
and down ) with functions. If you grep some binary with the pattern &quot;&lt;Key&quot;
you may get a good bunch of translation tables, but like you don't get the source code,
that use to be a useless effort regarded the events you are interested in, are not that
different of absolutely trivial events. </p>

<p>The last chance is callbacks, the name is enough self-explaining. They are function
pointers that are associated to some widget for taking care of one or more of its events.
Sometimes when you create a widget, the callback is supplied along with the creation
function (XmVaCreateSimplePulldownMenu), or may be it is added with function
XtAddCallback. Here is a pseudo definition of this function:<br>
<br>
XtAddCallback ( Widget, CallbackResource_name, func_pointer, NULL)<br>
<br>
The first var ( that you may get with editres ) is the widget identifier, the second one
is a string to identify the resource ( and the name should be consistent with the action
it takes ) and the third in the function ( the last one is data passed to the function,
but let's put it apart ). Here is a &quot;smart&quot; breakpoint that will supply the
whole XtAddCallback activity without getting the window manager in trouble (consult
previous linux essays for details):<br>
<br>
<small><font face="Courier New">(gdb) br *XtAddCallback<br>
...<br>
(gdb) commands<br>
&gt;silent<br>
&gt;x /s *(int*)($esp+8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
this show the callbackR name<br>
&gt;x /x ($esp+4)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... this shows the widget id<br>
&gt;x /x ($esp+0xc)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... this shows the function<br>
&gt;cont<br>
&gt;end</font></small><font face="Fixedsys">&nbsp; </font><br>
<br>
Now you may realize if your favourite widgets have got some interesting callback. A
conditional breakpoint will do for a concrete widget ( though it's hard to guess its
identifier before it's created :-). The callback resource name must match with some of the
resources showed in editres. Some common resource callbacks that apply to practically all
buttons:<br>
<br>
* armCallback: the function that draws the button &quot;pushed&quot;<br>
* activateCallback: the function called after a button push-release.<br>
* disarmCallback: the function that restores the graphic of the button once it <br>
&nbsp; is released<br>
<br>
Obviously you should be interested in the second one ;-).<br>
<br>
The last and strange possibility if to use an event handler. Despite it would not follow
motif &quot;Style guide&quot;, could be possible. These handlers are set with the function
pseudodeclared here: </p>

<p>XtAddEventHandler (Widget, Mask, More_mask_stuff, Event_h, NULL) </p>

<p>The function Event_h is called if there's an event that matches mask conditions,
obviously events that apply to widget Widget.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<u><strong><font face="Times New Roman">4. MORE TOOLS</font></strong></u><br>
<br>
Though you should already know the basic tools, you must keep an eye on other<br>
tools. <br>
<br>
<strong>DDD : <u>Data Display Debugger</strong></u><br>
<br>
This is not a new tool, I knew it months ago. Suppossedly it is used by software companies
( Adobe claims to use it :-), but the last version I checked ( 2.2 ) was still buggy, and
believe me, it's annoying to be cracking a program and a debugger at the same time. It is
really not a debugger, but a nice frontend for gdb. Just a few days ago I would tell you
not to use, it but I have just installed version 2.2.3 and, though it keeps old problems,
seems to fix most of the problems that made it crash. Assembler support is one of them
:-). <br>
If you finally try it, you may enjoy a beautiful assembler window, and what they call a
data window ( but is really a watch window :-(. Some other features will make your life
easier. For programs that carry a symbol table is a must.<br>
<a href="tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#463" tppabs="http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd">http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd</a><br>
</p>

<p><strong>NDASM: <u>Network Disassembler</strong></u></p>

<p>It is more a dumper than a disassembler. You must give it the starting offset of the
binary data inside the exe file. Anyway is a kind of universal assembler with which you
can build binaries for almost all operative systems using intel processors ( included ELF
binaries ). </p>

<p>I'm giving here a new version of dasm with a little fix and some new features (
call/jmp different xref, Function titles when symbol table available ). Again bugs, fixes
or suggestions at lluisote@hotmail.com.</p>

<p><big><u><strong>5. Cracking WordPerfect for Linux</strong></u></big><br>
<br>
In the case of Corel we find the same stupid attitude of Adobe ( or even worse ), trying
to make good moneys and succeding in getting their products unused. If WordPefect would
give for free its product in the linux/unix version, everybody would be using its program.
But instead of that, people prefer to buy StarOffice ( kind of a $uite ), to buy some
Windoze emulator ( as Wabi) and run some Win 3.1 word processor. One of the things is
missed in linux/unix is a good WYSIWYG processor. Then Corel makes a fairly good program (
if overbloated, as usual ) with many of the features of Word 97, but the concurrece
doesn't use it. </p>

<p>I hope this crack will make this program more popular, so I'm gonna give a &quot;ready
to use&quot; crack. It's hard to push Micro$osf competitors this way, but if the are
stupid ... </p>

<p>You all know the fairly hard ( bought ) protection of Corel Win32 applications. The
unix version is apparently developed by SDC ( come on stalk them :-), and the protection
is really weak ( may run for 1998 Most Stupid Award ). You'll not learn a great deal, but
IT IS (IMHO) AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR BEING CRACKED. </p>

<p>I'm cracking version 7.0.132. Download it at Corel site, it's a hard download ( more
than 30Mb + 10 Mb for language package ). Run the install script, and the executable
called &quot;xwp&quot; is a hideous monster of 7277808 bytes. Ok, seat down because after
dissasembling it you'll get an alien of 65 Mb ( you better get good RAM ). </p>

<p>When you run the program, a message is shown with &quot;The evaluation period will
expire in n days&quot;. I don't understand quite well the motif-system used with this
program, but don't care, we'll crack it with just the tools we know. First the message is
not in the executable, so after some grepping you'll find it inside the file
wp/shlib10/wpcerr.us. Let run the program through strace tool ( strace -o output_file xwp
), then look for the name of the file (in the output_file ) and you'll get something like
this:</p>

<p align="left" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0px"><font face="Fixedsys"><br>
</font><small><font face="Courier New">[4010ec0c]
open(&quot;/usr/local/flexlm/licenses/license.dat&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; He is heavily seeking this file, what a useless effort&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
[4010ec0c] open(&quot;/usr/local/wp/shlib10/wpcerr.us&quot;, O_RDONLY) = 13<br>
[4010eaf4] lseek(13, 3124, SEEK_SET)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 3124<br>
[4010f220] read(13, &quot;^r\0\0&quot;, 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 4<br>
[4010eaf4] lseek(13, 29278, SEEK_SET)&nbsp;&nbsp; = 29278<br>
[4010f220] read(13, &quot;The evaluation period for this d&quot;..., 2048) = 2048<br>
[4010df0a] close(13) </font></small></p>

<p>Don't you think is maravellous ? Now it is very easy to locate the last lseek, because
it is the only one in the whole program with offset 29278. And then breakpointing the next
read will lead to victory :-). </p>

<p>Let's use an advanced breakpoint in this case. This is the definition of lseek </p>

<p>off_t lseek(int fildes, off_t offset, int whence) </p>

<p>hence, the brk looks like this, (you'll think it looks awful, but I'm just casting a
pointer O:-):</p>

<p align="left" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0px"><font face="Courier New"><small>(gdb)
br *lseek if *(int*)($esp+8)==29278<br>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40105ae0<br>
(gdb) cont<br>
<br>
... gdb breaks after a while in the middle of some library<br>
<br>
(gdb) finish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* get back to xwp code */<br>
Run till exit from #0&nbsp; 0x4010620c in __read ()<br>
0x84f9762 in XMapRaised ()</small><br>
</font><font face="Fixedsys"><br>
</font></p>

<p>Ok, therefore the string is read at 84f9762. After some fishing on the stack, you'll
get the address of the buffer. In my case ( and should be yours ) is 0874e1a0. The next
step is breakpoint this location. </p>

<p>(gdb) awatch *( 0x0874e1a0 + 69 ) </p>

<p>( ... remember that the string is &quot;The evaluation period for this demonstration
software\nwill expire in ð\032\005ð day(s).&quot; I take care of the offset of the
number of days ) </p>

<p>Gdb will break at address 0x853dcbe. This code is overwriting the right value of the
number of days left. Using the &quot;back&quot; command ( like softice &quot;stack&quot; )
will be useful for tracking the target:</p>

<p align="left" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0px"><font face="Fixedsys"><br>
</font><small><font face="Courier New">(gdb) back<br>
#0&nbsp; 0x853dcbe in XMapRaised ()<br>
#1&nbsp; 0xbfffd8f4 in ?? ()<br>
#2&nbsp; 0x84f9531 in XMapRaised ()<br>
#3&nbsp; 0x84f938e in XMapRaised ()<br>
#4&nbsp; 0x850035a in XMapRaised ()<br>
#5&nbsp; 0x81002c5 in XMapRaised ()<br>
#6&nbsp; 0x80ffa5d in XMapRaised ()<br>
#7&nbsp; 0x80510cb in XMapRaised ()</font></small><font face="Fixedsys"><br>
<br>
</font>I'm not gonna get you bored with an endless tracking ( if you want it, get back to
Acrobat Reader essay ). As a summary, I'll tell you that the string is completely
overwritten with the same string ( included the number of days ). You may ask yourself how
the string could be copied without breaking. Remember that the brpt was set with an
offset, and the right string may be composed strcating the begining of the string with the
number formatted. After tracing back a couple of functions, you'll land in the middle of
this snippet:<font face="Fixedsys"><br>

<p>Thogh there's a growing number of linux users, it seems to me there's not a great
amount of linux reversers ( at least at assembler level and no source code ). For this
reason if any of you reading this, know any new tool or thinks he/she has the
knowledge/interest to program one, write to the +hcu or write to me.</p>
